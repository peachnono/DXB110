Rather than dictating interactions, designers have the ability to strategically design for interactions.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Interaction are dialogues -  Interactions, akin to dialogues, involve a two-way communication\u2014your device speaks to you through vibrations or messages, while your taps, clicks, or voice commands are your communication back to it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dialogues are designed for in the context of a design intention - Consider that you\u2019re designing a new alarm clock app. A way to describe what you\u2019re doing might be designing for a dialogue that results in the user being able to set an alarm.  In designing the app, the challenge lies in choosing which dialogues to prioritize\u2014setting, canceling, saving, adjusting time, changing alarm sounds, or integrating with other apps like Spotify. Deciding the relationships between these interactions adds complexity to the design process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interaction design is more useful for designing with complex things - In interaction design, complexity dictates its utility. Systems with many states and diverse user actions, like computers or remote controls, benefit significantly from IXD, whereas simpler devices, like desk lamps, may not require as much design consideration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Interactions, whether between people or between a person and a thing, are akin to dialogues\u2014they evolve over time. Just like meeting a new friend, the experience changes from initial pleasantries to deep conversations. Interacting with a software, alarm clock, or any other item follows a similar progression, with the complexity of the thing, social context, and user abilities all influencing the design considerations. Interactions, being two-way and situational, can be crafted for but not rigidly designed, making them dynamic and evolving over time.</p>"},{"location":"week1/#ixd-is-a-way-of-viewing-the-world","title":"IXD is a way of viewing the world","text":"<p>IXD is a way of viewing the world as a ser of designed interactions between people.</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on intentional, designer-crafted interactions</li> <li>Evaluates usability, accessibility, pleasure, intuitiveness, feedback, and responsiveness</li> <li>Utilizes a specialized language: user experience, personas, wireframes, prototypes, etc.</li> <li>Explores tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, without strict constraints and engages in methods such as user research and prototyping, adaptable to</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week2/","title":"Week 2: Introduction to Design Research","text":"<p>Note: These notes are referenced from course material at DXB110 at the QUT School of Design, A/Prof Nick Kelly</p> <p>Quick Links</p> <ul> <li>Lecture Slides</li> <li>Tutorial Slides, 9AM-11AM FRI Tutorial Slides</li> <li>Weekly Reading</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week2/#how-to-interview","title":"How to Interview","text":"<ul> <li>Focus on goals first, tasks second</li> <li>Use open-ended questions (avoid leading questions).</li> <li>This means no yes/no questions, or answering your question in how you phrase it!</li> <li>Assume the role of apprentice, not expert</li> <li>Avoid making the user a designer</li> <li>Avoid discussing technology</li> <li>Encourage storytelling</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week2/#conducting-an-interview","title":"Conducting an Interview","text":"<ul> <li>Make sure to give the participant time  </li> <li>Don\u2019t be afraid of silence \u2013 it\u2019s often your participant thinking through a potentially insightful answer</li> <li>Delve deeper, follow threads, and ask follow-up questions</li> <li>Ask for clarification if you\u2019re unsure or the answer is ambiguous \u2013 don\u2019t make assumptions</li> <li>Record where possible, take notes if not</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week2/#reporting-an-interview","title":"Reporting an Interview","text":"<ul> <li>Give insight into what you understand from the interviewee \u2013 don\u2019t just parrot back what they said.</li> <li>Draw links between what they say and the design problem</li> <li>Integrate the big picture with direct quotes and analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week2/#planning-semi-structured-interviews","title":"Planning semi-structured interviews","text":""},{"location":"week2/#goal-oriented-questions","title":"Goal-oriented questions","text":"<ul> <li>Goal: What makes a good day?
