## Introduction
Australia’s peak body for Design, the Design Institute Australia (DIA) lists the following categories in which design is formally practiced:

- Communication (digital media, graphic design, etc.) 
- Object (industrial, furniture, jewellery, etc.) 
- Systems (design management, service design) 
- Spatial (interior design, interior decoration, set design) 

## What are IXD and UX design all about?
Interaction Design is about designing for dialogues between beings and complex things 

### What is an Interaction?
An interaction involves a being (human or animal), a thing (a designed object or service), and a design intention (the circumstance for why the interaction exists). 

### Can interactions be designed? 
While interactions themselves cannot be directly controlled, a designer plays a pivotal role in shaping the context for these exchanges. Rather than dictating interactions, designers have the ability to strategically design for interactions.

- **Interaction are dialogues** -  Interactions, akin to dialogues, involve a two-way communication—your device speaks to you through vibrations or messages, while your taps, clicks, or voice commands are your communication back to it.

- **Dialogues are designed for in the context of a design intention** - Consider that you’re designing a new alarm clock app. A way to describe what you’re doing might be *designing for a dialogue that results in the user being able to set an alarm.* 
In designing the app, the challenge lies in choosing which dialogues to prioritize—setting, canceling, saving, adjusting time, changing alarm sounds, or integrating with other apps like Spotify. Deciding the relationships between these interactions adds complexity to the design process.

- **Interaction design is more useful for designing with complex things** - In interaction design, complexity dictates its utility. Systems with many states and diverse user actions, like computers or remote controls, benefit significantly from IXD, whereas simpler devices, like desk lamps, may not require as much design consideration.

Interactions, whether between people or between a person and a thing, are akin to dialogues—they evolve over time. Just like meeting a new friend, the experience changes from initial pleasantries to deep conversations. Interacting with a software, alarm clock, or any other item follows a similar progression, with the complexity of the thing, social context, and user abilities all influencing the design considerations. Interactions, being two-way and situational, can be crafted for but not rigidly designed, making them dynamic and evolving over time.

## IXD is a way of viewing the world 
IXD is a way of viewing the world as a ser of designed interactions between people.

- Focuses on intentional, designer-crafted interactions
- Evaluates usability, accessibility, pleasure, intuitiveness, feedback, and responsiveness
- Utilizes a specialized language: user experience, personas, wireframes, prototypes, etc.
- Explores tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, without strict constraints and engages in methods such as user research and prototyping, adaptable to

## Tutorial Notes
### Activity: Interaction as dialogue
**In pairs:**

- Person A is trying to order a customized tuna salad with a gluten-free requirement.
- Person B is a touchscreen for ordering salads.
- Person B (the app) starts the dialogue by asking a question that makes a potential response obvious.
- You can only communicate using post-it notes.

### Reflection
**How did this make you think about dialogue between people and things?**

**Why did the touchscreen go first?**  
The touchscreen goes first because the person doesn't know where to start.

**What are some key things that go into a 'successful' or 'fluid' dialogue?**  
Yes and No questions are important or just selections in general because it limits the scope and makes it simpler.

### Dialogue is a two-way communication  
**Part 1: An Opening** - An invitation to interact  
**Part 2: The Middle** - The exchange of needs/information in both directions  
**Part 3: An Ending** - The closing of a conversation
